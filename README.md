Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Diabetes detection model will use large dataset to make rules using machine learning to further predict on new data whether the person is diabetic or not. Three ML models are demonstrated and compared based on various metrics such as precision, recall and AUC.
The dataset used for training is provided in zip as well as csv format. The dataset is taken from Kaggle namely- Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
